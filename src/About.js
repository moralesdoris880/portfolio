            <p>Hi, My name is Doris and I am based in New York. I would say I am an inventor which falls under a big umbrella of skills. I am currently studying at Flatiron School for Software Engineering.
            I love creating things from art to web applications. I hope to one day work at a government or private space agency (yes, very specific). I have alot of hobbies from sketching, sewing, painting, playing instruments (Bass,Kalimba) and playing video games.
            I hope this year to add building Model Rockets and robots to the list. I would add traveling to the list but due to Covid-19 I have not been able to travel. I am also a big animal, nature and music lover.       
            </p>
